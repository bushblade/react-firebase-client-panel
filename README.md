## The final project in Brad Traversy's react front to back

### my brief review from the completing the course

⭐⭐⭐★★

I have a few of Brad's Udemy courses and in general I think they are very good and I have learnt a lot.

I think one failing this course has that all of his courses suffer for is a lack of response to Q&A, either from himself or a course TA (I don't think there are any course TA's), there are pages and pages of unanswered questions in the course Q&A

The explanations could be a lot better and much of the course I feel is rushed with many important details being skipped over.

This is not a course to learn firebase, or redux I would say. Redux is covered but with little explanation on what is a complex topic. Firebase is used but with a additional package react-redux-firebase, which is a great package for react but also abstracts both firebase and redux from the learning, which kind of misses the point of the course I feel.

This is not one of Brad's best courses, I would advise anyone looking for a react and or redux course to not choose this one.

I have learnt a lot from doing the course but more from having to look stuff up and find out the answers myself, which is fine but not what I expect from a paid for course. The course is not up to date, Brad does not follow react best practices in the course.

I feel I have a pretty good working knowledge of react coming away from the course but more through my own learning and side projects than from the content of this course directly. I am very dissapointed with the redux portions of this course and feel I have learnt little about redux from this course.
